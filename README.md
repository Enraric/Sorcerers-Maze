Sorcerers-Maze
==============


## Basic Concept:

You play as Caranthil, an apprentice sorcerer who wishes to learn from the greatest sorcerer ever, Citharion. However, in order to prove your worth, you have to survive Citharionâ€™s monster-infested maze by collecting the four elemental keys, then unlocking the final door to escape. Scattered throughout the maze are spellbooks which you can use to learn new spells for fighting monsters and traversing the maze.

## How this is going to work:

The game will be screen based (a-la-Legend of Zelda), with each screen or group of screens having a unique theme (earth, wind, fire, ice). Within each theme, there is one key and one spellbook. The keys are required to complete the game, and the spells are for use in other themes (i.e. fire spell being used to melt ice walls).

## Spells:

* Burst (standard): 
* Blaze Toss (fire):
* Gale Push (wind):
* Frozen Bridge (ice):
* Burrow (earth):
